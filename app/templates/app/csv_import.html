<p>CSV files are provided by openbeerdb.com under Open Database License.  They were slightly modified
	to rename duplicates (styles.csv had Porter & American-Style Amber Lager each listed twice), and 
	headers were renamed to coincide with database models included in this package.</p>
<p>Arbitrary CSV files can be utilized, provided that headers coincide with database models included
	in this package.  For import to successfully work, filenames must be: styles.csv, breweries.csv, or beers.csv</p>
<p>Valid header names for the following CSV files *must* include:</p>
<li>styles.csv</li>
<ol>name</ol>
<li>breweries.csv</li>
<ol>name, country, origin_state, origin_city, production, url, description</ol>
<li>beers.csv</li>
<ol>name, brewer*, style*, edition, abv, calories_oz, carbs_oz, original_gravity, specific_gravity, description, untappd_beer_id</ol>
<ol>* these fields must contain a key id corresponding to proper relations in styles.csv and breweries.csv</ol>
<p>For the love of god, make sure the CSV file uploaded is encoded UTF-8.  Export CSV as CSV (comma delimted).  Then open notepad and import the exported CSV file as UTF-8 and save as UTF-8 CSV if you have to.</p>
